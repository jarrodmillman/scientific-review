    `Beyond open access: visions for open evaluation of scientific papers by
    post-publication peer review
    <http://www.frontiersin.org/Computational%20Neuroscience/specialtopics/beyond_open_access__visions_fo/137>`_
    
    #. Open evaluation is defined as `an ongoing post-publication process of
       transparent peer review and rating of papers`
    
    #. They are looking for papers that "focus on constructive ideas and
       comprehensive designs for open evaluation systems."
    
    #. They raise a number of interesting questions, which we should keep in
       mind as we work on this article:
    
       - Should the reviews and ratings be entirely transparent, or should some
         aspects be kept secret?
        
       - Should other information, such as paper downloads be included in the
         evaluation?
        
       - How can scientific objectivity be strengthened and political
         motivations weakened in the future system?
        
       - Should the system include signed and authenticated reviews and
         ratings?
        
       - Should the evaluation be an ongoing process, such that promising
         papers are more deeply evaluated?
        
       - How can we bring science and statistics to the evaluation process
         (e.g. should rating averages come with error bars)?
        
       - How should the evaluative information about each paper (e.g. peer
         ratings) be combined to prioritize the literature?
        
       - Should different individuals and organizations be able to define their
         own evaluation formulae (e.g.  weighting ratings according to different
         criteria)?
        
       - How can we efficiently transition toward the future system?

A continuous, transparent peer review and paper rating system

.. class:: abstract

   A short version of the long version that is way too long to be written as a
   short version anyway.

Introduction
------------

- look at code review process and NumPy documentation editor
- look at Wikipedia's review process
- the idea of a living, growing document, rather than a series of articles each with the same tedious introduction
- scientist typically have a few scientific projects -- more like a software project
