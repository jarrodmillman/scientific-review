Scientific Review

.. note::

   We should be as domain-specific as possible.  Keep bring discussion back
   to our experiences.  Use journals in our field as often as possible.  Talk
   about the multi-disciplinary nature of the field and of the increasing
   shift toward large-scale computations.

   This is a computational neuroscience journal, but we should focus on
   the large field of neuroscience.

   We can't talk about review without talking about paper structure/content.

- origin of scientific publication
  - purpose of scientific publication
    - academic discourse 

- review of current practices
  - standard practice
  - few innovations
    - open access
    - public reviewers
    - non-anonymous reviews for authors
    - arxiv.org
    - Open Research Computation
    - SciPy Proceedings
    - biomed central

- remaining problems w/ current practice
  - tied to academic review (tenure, grants, etc.)
    - need to maximize publication number
    - repetitive text in most papers
    - what is the information delta?
  - difficulty in timely review
    - any given reviewer isn't expert in all aspects of a given paper
    - hard to find enough available, knowledgable reviewers
    - timestamp for scientific credit
    - information hidden until publication for fear of being scooped
  - contributions of authors
    - unclear acknowledgement of contributions
    - all information contained in author order
    - major lab heads perform essential supervisory role, put on
      papers as last author
    - graduate students, RAs not always adequately credited
    - often methodologistist, staff statisticians consulted,
      but not always credited
  - reviews are very important, but not acknowledged
  - important information from reviews not publicly available
  - incorrect published results not easy to remove
    - retractions published in separate papers, often
      not as visible as initial results

- reproducible research
  - computational results are advertised in journals, but
    the actual work to generate graphs, figures, results
    not adequately presented
  - how to review code?

- problems with current paper format
  - can't talk about the review process w/out discussing the
    format/content of what is being reviewed
  - not living document
  - introductions (repeated in every paper...)
  - classic format doesn't apply to computational research easily

- analogy with Law Review Journals
  - editorial staff all law students

- analogies with wikipedia
  - compendium of knowledge
  - look at their review process
  - discuss problems with their model

- analogies with modern best-practices in code review
  - web-based discussions
    - discussion graph
  - inline comments
  - mulitple reviewers
  - timely reviews
  - most important community members are often not authors
    - Linus doesn't write code anymore

- solutions
  - open reviews
    - open for comments
    - timely 
    - make paper best it can be
  - incremental science
  - new measures for impact factors
    - higher impact discussions rather than just citations
   
  - micro-reviews
    - review by best experts
    - muli-tiered review (perhaps by graduate students/postdocs and then by experts)
